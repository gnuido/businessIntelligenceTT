#The zero moment of truth

Unit 1

Among marketing departments it has been stablished that there are two "moments of truth" to be won by a company in a costumer's decision making process. A. G. Lafley (former CEO of P&G) defines these two as:
-The first moment of truth (FMOT): when a potential costumer is standing in front of a shelf full of different options for a single product (for example, a young sigle man looking at four different vanilla yogurt brands).
-The second moment of truth (SMOT): already bought, the product is tested and the costumer decides if it meets the expectations.

However, smartphones have changed shopping habits in most parts of the world. In the US a survey (Shopper Sciences, n=5000) has revealed three significant changes:
-70% of survied customers look up reviews online before buying a product.
-70% use smartphones to aid their shopping.
-80% will search for a product online (for information and reviews) after hearing about it in a commercial.

Therefore, a new moment of truth has to be pondered into the equation involving the gathering of information online and it was defined as the zero moment of truth (ZMOT).

Unit 2

The old mental model of marketing involved three steps that have already been described:
-stimulus: first contact with the product, either through a commercial, someone's commentary, etc.
-shelf: customer's process when "standing in front of a shelf" with a plethora of options in brands, models, quality, among other things.
-experience: product acquisition and first use, when the expectations are met or crushed by said product.

The shelf and experience steps have been defined as the first and second moments of truth, while the stimulus is rather a primer for the process. After it, and before the first moment of truth, is where the zero moment of truth lies, as the trend is making customers face the shelves with a load of information gathered beforehand.
As a consequence, there's now a whole new market for review related content; subjectively, flooding the online space with "influencers" trying to shape people's opinion on sponsored products.
