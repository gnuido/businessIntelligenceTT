Unit 1 - Old school marketing 

In marketing, it has been long stablished that there are two "moments of truth" to be won by a company in a costumer's decision making process.
A. G. Lafley (former CEO of P&G) defines these as:
-The first moment of truth (FMOT): when a potential costumer is standing in front of a shelf full of different options for a single product (for example, a young sigle man looking at four different vanilla yogurt brands).
-The second moment of truth (SMOT): once purchased, the costumer decides if the product meets the expectations.

However, time has changed shopping habits in most parts of the world. In the US, a survey (Shopper Sciences, n=5000) has revealed three significant changes:
-70% of survied customers look up reviews online before buying a product.
-70% use smartphones to aid their shopping.
-80% will search for a product online (for information and reviews) after hearing about it in a commercial.
#Even though this trend can be a good representation of only a part of the US, truth is, it will impact (even if in a lower scale) in the whole western world.

Unit 2 - Origin of the ZMOT

The old mental model of marketing will then involve three steps:
-stimulus: first contact with the product, either through an ad, by watching a TV commercial of any sort, mouth-to-mouth recommendation, by window shopping, etc.
-shelf: customer's process when "standing in front of a store shelf", facing a plethora of options that vary in branding, models, quality, design, country of origin, warranty period, among others things.
-experience: product acquisition and first time use, the expectations are either met or crushed by results.
#Notice that these are first impressions, given that at this point only short term used data can be collected.

The second (shelf) and last (experience) steps have been defined as the first and second moments of truth, while the stimulus is rather a primer in the process.
This is where the new trends in shopping take effect, after taking interest in a product the customer tends to gather information instead of going to a store and browse the options blindly. This provides the customers of a better insight of what specific products are a better fit for their needs, what price range should they be aiming for, or what features they might want to ask about.
This new step is what has been named the zero moment of truth (ZMOT) by Dina Howell (P&G FMOT Department).

Unit 3 - Importance of the ZMOT

ZMOT relies on five fundamental ideas:
-Happens online, especially through search engines.
-Happens at all times, every time, no matter how small a pruchase may seem.
-Gives part of the control back to the customer, as in "information is power".
-It satisfies the inner need for efficiency, best results in less time.
-Conversations are now "multithreaded", where many (marketers, reviewers, other customers and companies among them) can compete for the attention and time during a customer's online research.
#Dogmas are, by definition, a series of beliefs that are to be followed, with little to no evidence to support them. These previous ideas are dogmas in some ways, there is data gathered around the influence of ZMOT in a customer's process but they are also expected to be followed as a general guideline in marketing efforts.

ZMOT gains relevance for lower income homes, as every purchase will be relatively more impactful.
Notice how this does not depend on the magnitude of the purchase, surveys (Shopper Sciences, n=500) will show that people will spend more time and engage sooner for more expensive purchases, but even for lesser products at least a brief ZMOT will happen.

Unit 4 - The mouth-to-mouth process

Crowdsourcing opinions about products or services has always existed, ZMOT novelty comes with reach, as now online reviews immediately spread for dozens, hundreds or thousands to read.

There are three main topics often discussed:
-saving money.
-saving time.
-life improvement.

With average products (that is, products that aren't made with the lowest quality standards possible) reviews kind of follow a trend:
-most are good, as 80% of them are written by the top 20% of customers by lifetime value (from now on, "super shoppers").
-bad reviews add credibility to the reviews.
#This observation was made by the author as a way to imply there're hardly any downsides to ZMOT, while benefits are plenty. There's a strong marketing bias disguised as a social feature.

Unit 5 - Universality of ZMOT

In unit 3 it was introduce the idea that ZMOT will always happen. This is also valid for specialized industries or trades, such is the case of General Electric's jet engines branch. Although it might not be useful for the general public, the competition is doing it so they are forced to put themselves "out there" as well. In the future, if that general public needs to locate somebody in the trade they will have General Electric in mind.
#There's a particular behaviour for products that are aimed for the general public consumption but require a certain level of skill. Most ads, reviews, and even the manufacturer's website are going to be aimed at the average joe and there is going to be little to no specialized information avaliable (at least in plain sight) since the objective is to feed the ZMOT. For that, the use of pre-made marketing phrases and trending key words (like crypto or AI, nowadays, even if wrongly used) are more effective.
#Notice how the author fails or avoids to mention anything remotely negative about marketing.

Unit 6 - The strategy of ZMOT

The management of the ZMOT is going to be splitted into seven fronts:
trending terms
-Someone has to be in charge of the ZMOT, a proper person has to be selected to be a dynamic agent that interacts with the many departments (mostly those dedicated to marketing) and provide a useful insight on how to enhance the customer's experience. The creation of said role implies the raise of a proper budget, a short one denies accessibility to different tools used in ZMOT.

-The ZMOT design has to be customized for each industry,
