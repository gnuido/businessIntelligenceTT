#The zero moment of truth

Unit 1

Among marketing departments it has been stablished that there are two "moments of truth" to be won by a company in a costumer's decision making process. A. G. Lafley (P&G former CEO) defines these two as:
-The first moment of truth (FMOT): when a potential costumer is standing in front of a shelf full of different options for a single product (for example, a young sigle man looking at four different vanilla yogurt brands).
-The second moment of truth (SMOT): already bought, the product is tested and the costumer decides if it meets the expectations.

However, smartphones have changed shopping habits in most parts of the world. In the US a survey (Shopper Sciences, n=5000) has revealed three significant changes:
-70% of survied customers look up reviews online before buying a product.
-70% use smartphones to aid their shopping.
-80% will search for a product online (for information and reviews) after hearing about it in a commercial.

Therefore, a new moment of truth has to be pondered into the equation, involving the collection of information online. This one is defined as the zero moment of truth (ZMOT), and the whole process can be thought like a succession of critical moments: stimulus -> shelf -> experience.
