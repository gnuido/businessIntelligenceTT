#The zero moment of truth

Unit 1 - Introduction

Among marketing departments it has been stablished that there are two "moments of truth" to be won by a company in a costumer's decision making process. A. G. Lafley (former CEO of P&G) defines these two as:
-The first moment of truth (FMOT): when a potential costumer is standing in front of a shelf full of different options for a single product (for example, a young sigle man looking at four different vanilla yogurt brands).
-The second moment of truth (SMOT): already bought, the product is tested and the costumer decides if it meets the expectations.

However, smartphones have changed shopping habits in most parts of the world. In the US a survey (Shopper Sciences, n=5000) has revealed three significant changes:
-70% of survied customers look up reviews online before buying a product.
-70% use smartphones to aid their shopping.
-80% will search for a product online (for information and reviews) after hearing about it in a commercial.

Therefore, a new moment of truth has to be pondered into the equation involving the gathering of information online and it was defined as the zero moment of truth (ZMOT).

Unit 2 - Origin of the ZMOT

The old mental model of marketing involved three steps that have already been described:
-stimulus: first contact with the product, either through a commercial, someone's commentary, etc.
-shelf: customer's process when "standing in front of a shelf" with a plethora of options in brands, models, quality, among other things.
-experience: product acquisition and first use, when the expectations are met or crushed by said product.

The shelf and experience steps have been defined as the first and second moments of truth, while the stimulus is rather a primer for the process. After it, and before the first moment of truth, is where the zero moment of truth lies, as the trend is making customers face the shelves with a load of information gathered beforehand.
As a consequence, there's now a whole new market for review related content; subjectively, flooding the online space with "influencers" trying to shape people's opinion on sponsored products.

Unit 3 - Importance of the ZMOT

ZMOT has five dogmas it will rely on:
-Happens online, especially through search engines.
-Happens at all times, every time, no matter how small a pruchase may seem.
-It gives part of the control back to the customer.
-It satisfies an inner need to find the "best" option, so it serves a personal function as well.
-It involves "multithread" conversations, where many (marketers, reviewers, other customers and companies among them) compete for attention and time during a customer's online research.

ZMOT has a tendency to be more relevant for lower income homes, as every purchase will be relatively more impactful. Surveys (Shopper Sciences, n=500) will also show that depending the magnitude of the purchase people will take more or less time in the ZMOT, and it tends to happen farther from the final purchase the most expensive and "important" it is. 
With all this information, it is inmediate that companie's marketing strategies had to take a forced turned.
