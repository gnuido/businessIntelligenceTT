Unit 1 - Old school marketing 

In marketing, it has been long stablished that there are two "moments of truth" to be won by a company in a costumer's decision making process.
A. G. Lafley (former CEO of P&G) defines these as:
-The first moment of truth (FMOT): when a potential costumer is standing in front of a shelf full of different options for a single product (for example, a young sigle man looking at four different vanilla yogurt brands).
-The second moment of truth (SMOT): once purchased, the costumer decides if the product meets the expectations.

However, time has changed shopping habits in most parts of the world. In the US, a survey (Shopper Sciences, n=5000) has revealed three significant changes:
-70% of survied customers look up reviews online before buying a product.
-70% use smartphones to aid their shopping.
-80% will search for a product online (for information and reviews) after hearing about it in a commercial.
#Even though this trend can be a good representation of only a part of the US, truth is, it will impact (even if in a lower scale) in the whole western world.

Unit 2 - Origin of the ZMOT

The old mental model of marketing will then involve three steps:
-stimulus: first contact with the product, either through an ad, by watching a TV commercial of any sort, mouth-to-mouth recommendation, by window shopping, etc.
-shelf: customer's process when "standing in front of a store shelf", facing a plethora of options that vary in branding, models, quality, design, country of origin, warranty period, among others things.
-experience: product acquisition and first time use, the expectations are either met or crushed by results.
#Notice that these are first impressions, given that at this point only short term used data can be collected.

The second (shelf) and last (experience) steps have been defined as the first and second moments of truth, while the stimulus is rather a primer in the process.
This is where the new trends in shopping take effect, after taking interest in a product the customer tends to gather information instead of going to a store and browse the options blindly. This provides the customers of a better insight of what specific products are a better fit for their needs, what price range should they be aiming for, or what features they might want to ask about.
This new step is what has been named the zero moment of truth (ZMOT) by Dina Howell (P&G FMOT Department).

Unit 3 - Importance of the ZMOT
'''
ZMOT has five dogmas it will rely on:
-Happens online, especially through search engines.
-Happens at all times, every time, no matter how small a pruchase may seem.
-It gives part of the control back to the customer.
-It satisfies an inner need to find the "best" option, so it serves a personal function as well.
-It involves "multithread" conversations, where many (marketers, reviewers, other customers and companies among them) compete for attention and time during a customer's online research.

ZMOT has a tendency to be more relevant for lower income homes, as every purchase will be relatively more impactful. Surveys (Shopper Sciences, n=500) will also show that depending the magnitude of the purchase people will take more or less time in the ZMOT, and it tends to happen farther from the final purchase the most expensive and "important" it is. 
With all this information, it is inmediate that companie's marketing strategies had to take a forced turned.

Unit 4 - The mouth-to-mouth process

Crowdsourcing opinions about products or services has always existed, ZMOT novelty comes with reach, as now online reviews immediately spread for dozens, hundreds or thousands to read.
There are three main topics often discussed:
-saving money.
-saving time.
-life improvement.
With average products (that is, products that aren't made with the lowest quality standards possible) reviews kind of follow a trend:
-most are good, as 80% of them are written by the top 20% of customers by lifetime value (from now on, "super shoppers").
-bad reviews add credibility to the reviews.
